# 🧍ToAnimeConverter🧍
The project is based on another GAN, which is not mine. However, the setups etc. for something like this are always very complicated, so I thought I'd make a GUI (graphical user interface) so that the others can use it easier and better.

# ❓ Usage ❔
Compared to <a href="https://github.com/Fidode07/MinecraftToAIConverter">my old project</a>, the use of this one is quite simple. Just run the `'main.py'` with the command `python3 main.py` or `python main.py` (don't forget to go to the correct directory before).
